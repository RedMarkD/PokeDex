# PokeDex

>We, being our class of BeCode learners were tasked with creating a PokéDex.
>The goal is to finish this project in 3 days by ourselves and to have a working github pages version. 

## Deployment can be found at:  https://redmarkd.github.io/PokeDex/ 


>##The Learning Objectives
> * A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
> * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format;
> * DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.

## Features
Basic functionality:

###Searchability: 
You can search a pokémon by name and by ID 

###Display:
>* The ID-number
>* An image (sprite)
>* At least 4 "moves"
>* The previous evolution, only if it exists, along with their name and image. Be carefull, you cannot just do ID-1 to get the previous form, for example look into "magmar" - "magmortar". You have to use a seperate api call for this!
Visual:
Make the page at least slightly aesthetically pleasing or resembling a pokedex using CSS.
